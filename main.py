Python Movie Database Application

This code implements a movie database management system in Python.
You can start the program with the command: python3 movies.py

Functions:
- display_menu(): Displays the main menu of the application.
- list_movies(movies): Lists all movies in the database.
- add_movie(movies): Adds a new movie to the database.
- delete_movie(movies): Deletes a movie from the database.
- update_movie(movies): Updates the rating of a movie in the database.
- stats(movies): Displays statistics about the movies in the database.
- random_movie_and_rating(movies): Selects and displays a random movie from the database.
- search_movie(movies): Searches for a movie in the database.
- movies_sorted_by_rating(movies): Displays movies sorted by their ratings.
- create_rating_histogram(movies): Creates a histogram of movie ratings.

Flow:
1. Initializes a sample movie database.
2. Displays a menu of options to the user.
3. Processes user input to perform the selected operation.
4. Repeats steps 2-3 until the user chooses to exit.

Libary Moduls explained:
- random: For selecting random movies.
- matplotlib: For creating the rating histogram.
- thefuzz: For fuzzy string matching in the search function.
- colorama: For colored console output.
